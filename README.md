# Number_Guessing_Game

## Summary 

This is a number guessing game written in python.
The program executes through the terminal. 

## The Logic

The program algorithm executes in the following order.

1. The program first will ask for your name and store it.
2. The program will generate and store a random number between 1 and 20. The random number is generated using the ranInt() method from the random library.
3. The program will then ask for a number to guess between 1 and 20. 
4. The program then will go through a for loop that will execute up to 7 times or less. The conditions if the number is valid between 1 and 20. It will check if it is greater or lesser than the generated number and print a message telling the user if the number is too high or too low. 
5. If the number is guessed correctly it will tel the user congratulations, else the program will tell the user they took too many guesses when it hits seven inputs.

## To Do with This Project

There are several things I want to enhance with this project. 

1. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to let the user interact with the program.
